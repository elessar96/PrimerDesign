list of data.frames as produced by design_primers()

\description{
This function allows you to design qPCR/ddPCR primer and probe sets that fit to a large and very heterogeneous set of nucleic acid sequences. Multiple sets are designed for distinct clusters of sequences.
}
\details{
This function first calls the design_primer() function to design a primer-probe set that fits for as many of the input sequences as possible. Then, the remaining sequences are split into clusters according to their sequence similarity. If any of the clusters reach a size of min_cluster_size, an additional primer-probe set is designed for it.
